* Examples for Emacs Twist
This repository is a collection of examples that wraps (hopefully) various Emacs configurations using [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs-twist][Emacs Twist]].
It is provided as a Nix flake, so hopefully you will be able to run a configuration as a Nix app without officially installing it!
I am thinking of providing another layer of wrappers using [[https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap][bubblewrap]] on Linux.
